# Lab 11: Event Management

In today's lab, we will keep track of different kinds of events from a file. We will also be able to create new events and store them in the same file.

## Task

1. Fill in the missing constructors and toString methods in the various classes.
2. Implement the writeFile method in the Utility file
3. Print out the events loaded in the Main method
4. Add 4 more events in the main
5. Generate the content to write to the file by calling the `createFileContents` function in the Utility
6. Write the contents back to the events.csv file

## Submission

Correctly implement the missing functionality in the various files. Push your code to GitHub. Respond to the questions in the `response.txt` file. Push your response to GitHub. Submit the URL to your repository.
