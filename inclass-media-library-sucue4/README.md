# Media In Class

Given a Media class, inherited by a Movie and TVShow class, implement the missing methods in the Library class, then answer the questions in the `response.txt` file.

## Task

1. Look through each class and what is already implemented.
2. Following the format in the `main` method in the `Main` class, add 3 more movies and 3 more TV shows. Look at the respective constructors on what information is required. Note; the duration field in the TVShows is there to reference average length of an episode.
3. Implement the `findBest` method in the Library. This should return the highest rated media.
4. Implement the `longestShow` method in the Library. This should find and return the longest TV show. This can simply be the show with the most number of episodes. HINT: Reference how `mostExpensive` is implemented.
5. You may need to implement additional methods in other classes to accomplish longestShow or findBest.
6. Answer the questions in the `response.txt`.

## Submission

Push all of your code and the `response.txt`. Your response may not be 100% correct, but it should reflect your thinking and your understanding of the content.
