# Collection Practice: String Analysis

In today's in class, we will practice using HashSets and HashMaps to find information about a Sentenced entered by the user. You will implement three functions that will give us information about the sentence.

## Task

1. Implement the `getNonDuplicatingCharacters` function that returns a HashSet containing all of the characters, ignoring the duplicated values.
2. Implement the `getCounts` function that takes in the sentence and returns a HashMap containing the occurrence of each character.
3. Implement the `mostCommonLetter` function that takes in the HashMap returned in `getCounts` and returns the most common letter.
